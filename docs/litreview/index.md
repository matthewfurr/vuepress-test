## From TAGA

This research for thesis focuses on color variation in 4-color and expanded gamut printing. This literature review provides an overview of the mechanics and benefits of using gray component replacement separation techniques and the impact of additional ECG inks in producing stable predictable color. Included in the review are recent studies and literature on the principles of color theory, color reproduction, and color difference calculations.

## From O'Hara

This research involved optimizing the colorimetric characterization target through the application of compensation curves for tonal value increase in order to provide a more uniform sampling of the color gamut of a printing system. To support this investigation, the goals of process color printing are reviewed and the relationship between tone reproduction for each color printer and the resulting color gamut are examined. In addition, the principles of colorimetric characterization and the application of device profiles in a color-managed workflow are reviewed.

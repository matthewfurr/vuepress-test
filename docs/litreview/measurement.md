# Measurement

VT's homepage [frontmatter](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/frontmatter.html) configuration supports all options from [VuePress's default theme](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html#homepage), at the same time, VT introduce extra features:

1. Additional options: `subActionText`, `subActionLink`, `sponsors`.
2. Configure rich-text `heroText`, `tagline`, and `footer` via [Markdown Slot](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown-slot.html).

## Quick Start

1. Create `docs/index.md`, and declare `home: true` with [Frontmatter](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/frontmatter.html):

```md
---
home: true
---
```

2. Declare hero image and hero text:

```md
---
heroImage: /logo.svg
heroText: A Elegant VuePress Theme
---
```

If you want to use markdown syntax to define `heroText`, you can use [Markdown Slot](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown-slot.html):

```md
---
heroImage: /logo.svg
---

::: slot heroText
An <b class="gradient">Elegant</b> VuePress Theme
:::
```

3. Declare action buttons:

```md
---
actionText: Getting Started
actionLink: /guide/
subActionText: Install
subActionLink: /guide/
---
```

4. Declare main features:

```md
---
features:
- title: Full-text search
details: Full-text search is supported by default, no server dependency, distinguishing locales.
- title: Out of the box
details: Compatible with VuePress' default theme, built-in common documentation features, e.g. i18n, Code Copy, TOC.
- title: TypeScript

```

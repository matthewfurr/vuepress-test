# Conclusion

Overall, the seven-color builds were more stable than the four-color builds. This means that press variations have less of an effect on the printed color when reproduced with a seven-color ink set. The results for the alternative components are displayed in Table 4 (below). We see similar results but greater differences between the averages. We believe this is because of the difference in hue angles between the alternative components. The colored squares next to the ΔE values indicate the color of the component that was over- impressed. Unlike the common component squares, the colors are different between four-color and seven-color separations.

> WHERE IS IT?

In conclusion, expanded gamut inks are not only able to reproduce more spot colors with a larger gamut, but the color separations are more capable of holding color on press. This can be attributed to the expanded gamut inks adding more chromatic components to the ink set—the closer the chromatic components are in hue, the less they individually affect the overprinted process color build. The separation values from the 600 samples also show that approximately 15.5% less ink is required of seven-color builds.

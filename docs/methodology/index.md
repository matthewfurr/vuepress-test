## Methodology

The range of colors that can be reproduced by a given device is called a color gamut. In print, the process inks and their overprints define the boundaries of the color gamut. The size
of the gamut is limited by the saturation of the colorants into the substrate. In expanded gamut applications, the gamut is expanded by the addition of Orange, Green, and Violet inks. These inks are often referred to as intermediate secondary hues because they fall between the CMY and RGB primary hues. See Figure 1.

Logically constructed tint builds contain either two color components or three color components regardless of whether they are constructed from a four-color ink set or a seven-color ink set. Colors on the gamut boundary that are not neutral or dark enough to require a gray component will contain only two colorants, these are referred to as hue components. Colors inside the gamut boundary or those on the boundary that are dark enough to require a gray component will contain a total of three components, both the hue components and a gray component.

Two-component builds will be compared in “pairs.” For example, the ΔE of the seven- color build will be compared to the ΔE of the four-color build. Three component builds, builds requiring a gray component, will be compared in “triplets.” This is because colors that require a gray component can be built utilizing gray component replacement techniques. For these samples, the three- component builds constructed using the four-color ink set will be built using maximum gray component replacement (GCR) and no GCR. For example, a four-color ink set build of an orange can have either Black (Maximum GCR) or Cyan (the “opposite color” or no GCR) as a gray component. This is also true of seven-color ink set builds, however, for numerous reasons, it is not a common practice to build seven-color domain builds with a color other than Black as the gray component. As such, the comparison of three color builds will be done in triplets as follows:

1. four-color ink set with No GCR

vs.

2. four-color ink set with Maximum GCR

vs.

3. seven-color ink set with Maximum GCR

This will show how much of the color stability in the seven-color domain is related to 100% GCR as opposed to the additional chromatic components of Orange, Green, and Violet.

In a seven-color ink set the gamut utilizes six chromatic hues—this gives us the six slices seen in Figure 1. Within each slice, 50 two-component pairs and 50 three-component triplets will be created, printed with induced variations, measured, and compared.

## Tint Build Logic

In the seven-color domain, a two-component build will always include the two closest chromatic components. For example, all seven-color domain builds in the O-M slice will contain Orange and Magenta (see Figure 1). A three- component build will add Black.

In the four-color domain, a two-component build will also always include the two closest chromatic components— however, they will be different from the seven-color ink set build because O, G and V are not available inks in the four- color domain. For example, all four-color domain builds in the O-M slice will contain Yellow and Magenta because Orange is not an option in the four-color ink set. Additionally, all four- color domain builds in the Y-O slice will also contain Yellow and Magenta. A three-component build in the four-color domain will add either Cyan (the gray component for colors in the Y-M sector) or Black to the hue components above.

## Color Comparison Logic
Comparisons will be made “slice by slice.” For example, seven-color domain builds in the Y-O slice will be compared to four-color domain builds in the Y-O slice. Three types of comparisons will be made.

### Common Component Variation
The “common component” is the chromatic component that is common to both the four- color domain build and the seven-color domain build. For example, Yellow is the common component in the Y-O slice. Yellow will be intentionally altered on press. Comparison will be made of the 50 two- component builds printed as “pairs” as well as the 50 three- component builds printed as triplets (100 comparisons total).

### Alternative Component Variation
The “alternative component” is the chromatic component that is different in the four- color domain build than the seven-color domain build. For example, the alternative component in the Y-O slice of a seven-color domain build is Orange. However, the alternative component in the Y-O slice of a four-color domain build is Magenta. Orange will be intentionally altered on press for seven-color domain builds and Magenta will be intentionally altered on press for four-color domain builds Comparisons will be made of the 50 two- component builds printed as pairs as well as the 50 three- component builds printed as triplets (100 comparisons total).

### Gray Component Variation
The “gray component” is the non-chromatic component in a three-component build. In all Maximum GCR builds, the gray component is Black. In a build with no GCR, the gray component is the “opposite color” (e.g. Cyan for the Y-O or O-M slices). Black will be intentionally altered on press for both the four-color Max CGR builds and the seven-color Max GCR builds. The opposite color will be altered for all four-color no-GCR builds. Comparisons will be made of the 50 three- component builds printed as triplets in each of the 6 slices.

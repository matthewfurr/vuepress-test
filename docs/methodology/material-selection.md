# Material Selection

## Experimental Design

The experimental procedure was developed to investigate the effect of chromatic and graying components of process color tint builds. Materials were selected for the best optimization of the press and to ensure repeatability throughout the tests. This was achieved by the careful selection of inks, tooling, press conditions, and process control targets.

The general procedures were as follows: selection of materials, optimization of plates, optimization of press, P2P press run, characterization, samples selection, then final test target press run.

A seven station Omet VaryFlex 530 F1 narrow web press was used to print on a 1-mil white BOPP film, using UV curable inks. The CIELAB for the film white was L* 90.03, a* -1.43, b* -0.48. As defined by ISO 12647-6, a standard substrate color range for flexography must have a white point of ≥88 L*, 0 a* (±3), 0 b* (±3).

Environmental Inks and Coating formulated single-pigmented UV inks for the selected anilox configuration (1200cpi/1.7BCM & 900cpi/2.2BCM). Ink pigments, print sequence, and anilox configurations were selected based on former research for standardized data sets for expanded gamut. The results from the LAB and LCH values measured and recorded across six press taken throughout the press run are displayed in Table 1.

DuPont Cyrel FAST DFR plates with a thickness of 0.067” were optimized. Back exposure and face exposure tests were done to ensure a relief of approximately 0.020 inches. A laser focus test was completed, then the carbon mask density and post ablation densities were tested with a transmission densitometer to ensure proper ablation from the Esko Spark CDI. The plates were inspected for dot size and dot fail using a Betaflex Pro and a five-to- one bump curve applied in the RIP. Esko Screen Manager was used to output a benchmark plate (Figure 4) for both conventional and stochastic screens. The printed samples were evaluated to select the screening with the cleanest vignettes, lowest minimum printing value, stable highlights and minimum graininess. The screening selected for our configuration was HD Flexo C31 with no microcell and Monet stochastic with a 25-pixel dot for stochastic. All plates were imaged at 4000 ppi.

The press setup included a two-roll metering system with a reverse angle doctor blade. Flexo Concepts TruPoint Orange blades with a lamella tip were used. Plates were mounted on a medium density Lohmann 5.1+ DuploFLEX mounting tape. All press trials were run with a printing sequence of KOVCGMY and the press ran at a speed of 150 fpm.

When printing with more than four colors, screen angles have to be carefully chosen to avoid moiré problems. In order to avoid moiré, each ECG ink was placed on the same angle as the opposing complimentary color. For example, green was placed on the magenta angle, orange was placed on the cyan angle, and violet was placed on the both the yellow and black angle when printed with conventional screens. When printed conventionally, violet screens were object-oriented to ensure it was not at the back angle if overprinting with black. Violet was also printed with a stochastic screen to avoid moiré.

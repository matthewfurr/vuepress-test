# Measurements

The test charts were then read into i1 Profiler with an i1iO. A total of nine samples from each over-impressed ink were read and averaged together. Nine samples of the press sheet with no over-impression were gathered and averaged for the standard. The separation values and spectral data were output and a python script was written to process the data and calculate the ΔE. Spectral data was collected so that it could be converted to both CIELAB and LCh for both the ΔEab and ΔE2000 calculations. The script was also used to organize the samples. Since the targets were randomized, the separation values output with the spectral data was used to organize the samples back into each of the six slices of the gamut. Each slice of the gamut will be compared separately from each other.

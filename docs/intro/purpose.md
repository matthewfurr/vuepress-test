# Problem Statement

The migration in flexography from spot color printing to expanded gamut printing continues at a steady pace. An essential part of this migration is the change from reproducing brand colors using a single premixed “spot color” ink to using a combination of process color inks. Critical to this conversion is the subject of color variation.

With a set of 4 or 7 process colors, there is a virtual infinite number of combinations that can reproduce a given brand color. This research was conducted to determine if there is a widely applicable color build logic that results in the least amount of variation. This study also includes a look into the Total Area Coverage (TAC) for each color build and an analysis was run to calculate the relative ink consumption. Relative ink consumption will also show the ink usage between the two different builds.

## Significance of the Study

The challenge now lies in the implementation of expanded gamut printing. Before printers are willing to dedicate a press to expanded gamut printing, they must have a large enough volume of work to keep the press in production. This requires total buy-in from all parties involved from the top down. Color fidelity and consistency are of the upmost importance to the brand owner, and the aim of this research is to aid in the acceptance of expanded gamut process color tint builds for brand colors in the package printing industry.

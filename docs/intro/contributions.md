The proposed study will address the issue of whether it is advantageous to compensate for TVI prior to characterizing the press using colorimetric data. Calibrating a printing system for specified amounts of TVI via compensation curves prior to characterization has been advocated in industry specifications such as the third edition of Flexographic Image Reproduction Specifications and Tolerances (FIRST, 2003), but there are no published studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. On the contrary, draft documents of CGATS call for “separation films and digitally imaged plates [to] have a final linear relationship to the original data file” (CGATS/SC4 N 406 draft 2).

This research will investigate the effectiveness of compensating characterization targets for TVI. It is proposed that creating the compensation curve further optimizes the system to provide a more uniform sampling of the device color gamut and consequently should be included in the characterization process. This research will demonstrate whether or not compensated targets provide improved color control to printers and provide a model for color reproduction that demonstrates the potential of color management for the printing industry.

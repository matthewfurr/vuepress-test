# Hypothesis <Badge text="TAGA"/><Badge text="Review"/>

To test the research questions proposed, hypotheses were designed to evaluate and compare the average ΔE of seven-color and four-color samples against a controlled standard. The following hypotheses and their corresponding null hypotheses will be tested to determine whether statistically significant differences exist.

## Research Hypothesis 1

The color stability of a spot color reproduced using Maximum Gray Component replacement will be significantly more stable than the same spot color reproduced using no Gray Component replacement, as measured by mean ΔE 2000.

## Null Hypothesis 1

The color stability of a spot color reproduced using Maximum Gray Component replacement will not be significantly more stable than the same spot color reproduced using no Gray Component replacement, as measured by mean ΔE 2000.

## Research Hypothesis 2

The color stability of a spot color reproduced using a fixed 7-color ink set will be significantly more stable than the same spot color reproduced using the traditional four-color process ink set, as measured by mean ΔE 2000.

## Null Hypothesis 2

The color stability of a spot color reproduced using a fixed seven-color ink set will not be significantly more stable than the same spot color reproduced using the traditional four-color process ink set, as measured by mean ΔE 2000.

## Research Hypothesis 3

The relative ink consumption of spot colors reproduced using a fixed seven-color ink set will be significantly less than the same spot colors reproduced using a traditional four-color process ink set, as measured by mean Total Area Coverage.

## Null Hypothesis 3

The relative ink consumption of spot colors reproduced using a fixed seven-color ink set will not be significantly less than the same spot colors reproduced using a traditional four-color process ink set, as measured by mean Total Area Coverage.

## Original paragraphs for this section

The hypothesis is that a color build logic using a 7-color ink set and Maximum GCR results in the least color variation. This study also aims to show the difference in ink coverage between 7-color and 4-color. Therefore, a secondary hypothesis is that the same logic also results in the lowest ink consumption.

Theoretically, the closer the chromatic components are to the color they are producing, the less variance expected. Since the color components used for the 7-color domain are closer in hue angles, we do not expect to see as big of a shift as we would with the two colors used in the 4-color domain. We also expect that components closer in hue require less ink to reproduce the desired color. This is because components closer in hue angles require less of the alternative component to bring the color closer to the target values.

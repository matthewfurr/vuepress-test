Digital prepress systems rapidly became more widespread as the computational power of computers increased and the cost of computers decreased. Image manipulation software and low-end scanners became affordable to a wide range of designers and clients, and as desktop publishing systems became more available, prepress professionals had to receive input from and purpose images for a much broader range of devices. In the traditional printing model,  transparencies were provided to scanner operators who had control over the color conversion to a digital format. High-end photo-multiplier tube (PMT) drum scanners were the industry standard for color separation, and the separation settings were built into the image capture by the scanner operators. These “closed loop” systems were carefully calibrated to produce separations for specific printing conditions. Ink densities, dot gain curves and gray balance information were determined through densitometric evaluation of press characterizations, and images were converted from the RGB input of the scanner capture to the CMYK of a specific printing system on the fly. In a closed loop, the image capture settings are specific for the intended output device, and repurposing an image to other devices meant rescanning the image to create separations for each output (Sharma, 2004). In contrast, a color management system provides a relatively simple means of converting color between a multitude of devices.")]),e._v(" "),r("p",[e._v("Color management systems (CMS) use device profiles to quantify the color reproduction capabilities of the various components of the color reproduction system. The profile is essentially a look-up table between input to the color rendering component and the output from that component, relating digital information to actual color. For instance, in the case of a scanner or digital camera, the input to the system is the actual colors of the image or object being captured, and the output is the digital RGB values for each pixel comprising the image. For a press or a proofing device, the input is the digital information of the file (CMYK dot percentages) and the output is the actual colors of the printed sheet. The actual color can be quantified through spectral measurement; with a standard light source (D50 or D65) and a standard observer specified (2° or 10° observer), the spectral reflectance of the object defines the color. Using the spectral reflectance data and the spectral properties of the light source (D50 or D65) and the observer function (2° or 10°), the color can be rendered into an independent color space such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB. CIELAB is an independent color space in which colors are mapped onto three- dimensional axes of light/dark (L*), red/green (a*) and yellow/blue (b*). In most color management systems, either CIELAB or CIEXYZ serves as the profile connection space (PCS), a common currency to allow color transformations between color devices. Each device renders colors through the application of colorants—in the case of a press, the colorants are applied in dot percentages of CMYK; for a scanner or digital camera, the colorants are RGB pixels. These colorants are the ingredients each device uses to create specified colors; the specific combinations of CMYK/RGB may be thought of as recipes. The profile for each device is a look-up table between all the colors that device can render, as specified in CIELAB, to the recipes the device requires for each color. In this way, the CMS can relate each device in a color reproduction system to CIELAB, the profile connection space. The PCS serves as a digital hub for color transforms; instead of relating each device to each other in a series of one-to-one, closed-loop relationships, each device is related to the PCS, and from the PCS color transforms can be accomplished to any device that has a profile in the color management system.

For example, scanners and digital camera, which serve as input devices for the color reproduction system, are profiled by capturing a color target with known LAB values and measuring the RGB values that result from the image capture (Sharma, 2004). In each case, the color of the object is transformed into RGB pixels by using filters to separate the image. All filters are not the same, and different devices will derive different RGB pixels. The profile relates the input LAB to the resulting RGB pixels. As it is impractical to capture every possible color, color management systems use color targets that are comprised of a strategically selected sample of color representing an array of hues at various lightness and chroma levels. The profile creation software then performs a series of computations that interpolate between the sampled colors to create a look-up table to provide “recipes” for all of the colors that the device is capable of producing.")]),e._v(" "),r("p",[e._v("In the case of printing systems, the input to the system is the digital CMYK dot percentage values and the output is the color that results.

To create the profile for a printing system, a look-up table is generated by printing a strategic sample of the possible CMYK input values and measuring the LAB colors that are output.

This intention is further documented in CGATS/SC4 N 406, How to run a good press testfor development of a color characterization data set (Draft 2), which states, “tone reproduction on separation films and on digitally imaged plates should have a final linear relationship to the original data file” (CGATS/SC4 N 406 draft 2). However, others have proposed alternative approaches to the characterization. The third edition of the Flexographic  Image Reproduction Specifications and Tolerances (FIRST) recommends that colorimetric characterization is best performed if the printing system is calibrated for a specific amount of TVI—17% midtone gain, such that the 50% tint prints as a 67% tint (FIRST, 2003). FIRST claims that this amount of TVI will provide the best distribution of colorimetric data from an IT8.7/4 target. In a presentation at the FFTA’s 2003 FIRST conference, Mark Samworth of Artwork Systems, Inc. advocated the use of TVI compensation with ICC profiling, particularly for flexography, which typically has higher TVI than offset lithography. In this presentation, Samworth suggested that by taking the adjustment for TVI away from the profile, the profile does not have to “move” the color as much. TVI is a one-dimensional change that can be best addressed through a compensation curve, while the colorimetric properties of the inks and their overprints are best addressed through a profile (Samworth, 2003). Samworth further argued that the compensated target provides better highlight sampling for improved color transforms.")]),e._v(" "),r("p",[e._v("Currently, there is no published experimental study on the effectiveness of applying compensation curves to characterizations in order to improve color reproduction.
